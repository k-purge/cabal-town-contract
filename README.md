# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation for Cabal.town! This GitBook serves as the foundation for understanding our innovative platform and its components.\


Our project is designed with a modular architecture to provide a seamless and integrated experience across various technologies. It comprises four key components:

1. **Smart Contract**

• Secure and trustless interactions powered by TON network.

• This GitBook focuses on this component, detailing its structure, functionality, and deployment process.

2. **Client Application**

• A user-facing interface offering a smooth and intuitive experience.

_(Currently under development)_

3. **Server Backend**

• The backbone of the platform, managing data, business logic, and API integrations.

_(Currently under development)_

4. **Telegram Bot**

• A lightweight and interactive way to access our platform through Telegram.

_(Currently under development)_\


We are actively working on delivering the remaining components and will update this documentation as new features are completed. For now, delve into our Smart Contract section to explore the core of our Jetton with bonding curve solution.



Thank you for joining us on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!\


Happy building!
